Reporting bugs and making suggestions
-------------------------------------

  - Opening an issue in this repo is the preferred way to report bugs. If you don't have and don't want to make a GitHub account, use the original forum thread instead.
  - The same applies to suggestions.
  - If an issue is related to a specific page or SCP document, prefix the issue with "Page bug: ". There is no need to add the title, but feel free to do so if it's short. Use a descriptive name for the issue please (especially if there's a lot of open issues already).
